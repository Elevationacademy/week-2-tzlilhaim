                    <p class="song-lyrics">Suzanne takes you down to her place near the river
                        You can hear the boats go by, you can spend the night forever
                        And you know that she's half-crazy but that's why you want to be there
                        And she feeds you tea and oranges that come all the way from China
                        And just when you mean to tell her that you have no love to give her
                        Then he gets you on her wavelength
                        And she lets the river answer that you've always been her lover
                        And you want to travel with her, and you want to travel blind
                        And you know that she will trust you
                        For you've touched her perfect body with your mind
                        And Jesus was a sailor when he walked upon the water
                        And he spent a long time watching from his lonely wooden tower
                        And when he knew for certain only drowning men could see him
                        He said all men will be sailors then until the sea shall free them
                        But he himself was broken, long before the sky would open
                        Forsaken, almost human, he sank beneath your wisdom like a stone
                        And you want to travel with him, and you want to travel blind
                        And you think you maybe you'll trust him
                        For he's touched your perfect body with her mind
                        Now, Suzanne takes your hand and she leads you to the river
                        She's wearing rags and feathers from Salvation Army counters
                        And the sun pours down like honey on our lady of the harbor
                        And she shows you where to look among the garbage and the flowers
                        There are heroes in the seaweed, there are children in the morning
                        They are leaning out for love and they wil lean that way forever
                        While Suzanne holds her mirror
                        And you want to travel with her, and you want to travel blind
                        And you know that you can trust her
                        For she's touched your perfect body with her mind.</p>

                    <p class="song-title">Chelsea Hotel #2 (1974)</p>
                    <p class="song-lyrics">I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
                        You were talking so brave and so sweet
                        Giving me head on the unmade bed
                        While the limousines wait in the street
                        Those were the reasons and that was New York
                        We were running for the money and the flesh
                        And that was called love for the workers in song
                        Probably still is for those of them left
                        Ah, but you got away, didn't you babe?
                        You just turned your back on the crowd
                        You got away, I never once heard you say
                        I need you, I don't need you
                        I need you, I don't need you
                        And all of that jiving around
                        I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
                        You were famous, your heart was a legend
                        You told me again you preferred handsome men
                        But for me you would make an exception
                        And clenching your fist for the ones like us
                        Who are oppressed by the figures of beauty
                        You fixed yourself, you said, "well, never mind
                        We are ugly but we have the music"
                        And then you got away, didn't you baby?
                        You just turned your back on the crowd
                        You got away, I never once heard you say
                        I need you, I don't need you
                        I need you, I don't need you
                        And all of that jiving around
                        I don't mean to suggest that I loved you the best
                        I can't keep track of each fallen robin
                        I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
                        That's all, I don't even think of you that often.</p>>

                    <p class="song-lyrics">I can't leave my house
                        Or answer the phone
                        I'm going down again
                        But I'm not alone
                        Settling at last
                        Accounts of the soul
                        This for the trash
                        That paid in full
                        As for the fall, it
                        Began long ago
                        Can't stop the rain
                        Can't stop the snow
                        I sit in my chair
                        I look at the street
                        The neighbor returns
                        My smile of defeat
                        I move with the leaves
                        I shine with the chrome
                        I'm almost alive
                        I'm almost at home
                        No one to follow
                        And nothing to teach
                        Except that the goal
                        Falls short of the reach</p>
